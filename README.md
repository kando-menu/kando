# What is Kando?

**üå∏ Kando is a cross-platform pie menu for your desktop.** It offers an unconventional, fast, highly efficient, and fun way of interacting with your computer! You can use Kando to launch applications, simulate keyboard shortcuts, open files, and much more.

Kando is designed to be used with üñ±Ô∏è mouse, üñäÔ∏è stylus, üëÜ touch, or üéÆ controller input. If you have both hands at your keyboard most of the time, Kando is maybe not the right tool for you.

You are welcome to join the üí¨ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy) to discuss the project, ask questions, or just to hang out with other Kando enthusiasts!

Kando runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
On Linux, most desktop environments are supported, however some require additional configuration.
Have a look at the [installation guide](https://kando.menu/installation-on-linux/) for more information.

# :revolving_hearts: I want to contribute!

**I am creating Kando out of sheer passion.** It is completely free, and I am not planning to monetize it in any way.
But I would be very happy if you could support the project with creative ideas, code contributions, or by sharing it with your friends and followers! üíñ

There are always some open issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which are a great starting point for new contributors.
Just drop a comment if you want to work on one of these issues, and we can discuss the details!

While direct contributions are the most awesome way to support the development, **donations will encourage me to invest my spare time for developing free and open-source software**.

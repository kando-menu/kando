# What is Kando?

**🌸 Kando is a cross-platform pie menu for your desktop.** It offers an unconventional, fast, highly efficient, and fun way of interacting with your computer! You can use Kando to launch applications, simulate keyboard shortcuts, open files, and much more.

Kando is designed to be used with 🖱️ mouse, 🖊️ stylus, 👆 touch, or 🎮 controller input. If you have both hands at your keyboard most of the time, Kando is maybe not the right tool for you.

You are welcome to join the 💬 [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy) to discuss the project, ask questions, or just to hang out with other Kando enthusiasts!

Kando runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
On Linux, most desktop environments are supported, however some require additional configuration.
Have a look at the [installation guide](https://kando.menu/installation-on-linux/) for more information.

# :rocket: How do I use Kando?

Kando comes with an example menu which you can open by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> on most platforms.
This is great to get a first impression!

# :revolving_hearts: Who creates Kando?

👋 Hi there! I am [**@Schneegans**](https://github.com/Schneegans/), a software developer from Germany who loves creating free and open-source software.
After [Gnome-Pie](https://github.com/Schneegans/Gnome-Pie) and [Fly-Pie](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie/), Kando is my third and most ambitious attempt to create a pie menu for the desktop.

Yet the project would not have been possible without the help of the community!
A big thanks to everyone who has contributed to Kando by reporting issues, suggesting features, translating texts, or writing code!

**Also, a huge thanks to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) for providing the code signing infrastructure and to the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) for providing a free code signing certificate for the Windows installers!**
For details, see also our [:handshake: Code-Signing Policy](https://kando.menu/code-signing/).

# :tada: I want to contribute as well!

Kando is completely free, but I would be very happy if you could support the project with creative ideas, code contributions, or by sharing it with your friends and followers! 💖

There are always some open issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which are a great starting point for new contributors.
Just drop a comment if you want to work on one of these issues, and we can discuss the details!

While direct contributions are the most awesome way to support the development, **donations will encourage me to invest my spare time for developing free and open-source software**.
